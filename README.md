# Modeling Perseveration Behavior in a Two-Step Decision-Making Task Using Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains our group project for the course, "Modeling in Cognitive Science" by Prof. Dr. Sebastian Musslick at the University Osnabrück.

In this project, we implement model-free, model-based and hybrid reinforcement learning agents train on the two-step task by Daw. et al (2011) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2011.02.027).

The full pipeline can be found and run in the final submission notebook, https://github.com/imtezcan/rl-twoStepTask/blob/main/hybrid_rl_modeling-TST.ipynb

Additionally, separate code pieces are provided. RL agent implementations can be found under the agents/ folder. Parameter fitting, parameter recovery and model recovery code, as well as the code for analysis are under the root folder.
